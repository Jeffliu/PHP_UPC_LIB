PHP UPC Barcode Checkdigit Calculator &amp; Validator

I was looking around for one of these and couldn't find one so I wrote it. I am sharing it as my first GitHub Project 

The code is meant to be easy to read and to see how UPC checksums are actually calcuated, it is not meant to be the smallest, most concise code possible.
